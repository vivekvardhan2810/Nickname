# Nickname
<p>A Short Code  takes user input for hobbies, favorite colors, and favorite movies, shuffles and combines them, and then creates a nickname by joining the shuffled inputs with underscores. Note that this is a simple rule-based approach, and for a more advanced solution, you may consider using machine learning models, such as natural language processing (NLP) models, to learn patterns and generate more personalized suggestions.</p>
